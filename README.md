# ðŸŽ¨ Color Picker

This React-based project offered an opportunity to explore the use of state and props in creating interactive web components.

About The Project

This project presents a simple color picker application where users can choose a color from the available options. The selected color is then highlighted and also displayed on the navbar.

Key features of the app include:

Displays three different color circles (Red, Blue, and Green).
Clicking on a color circle updates the navbar to reflect the selected color.
The selected color circle is highlighted with a border.
Implementation

The application is built using React and leverages the power of the useState hook for state management. Each color circle is a reusable 'Color' component that receives properties like the color name, a function to set the selected color, and the currently selected color.
